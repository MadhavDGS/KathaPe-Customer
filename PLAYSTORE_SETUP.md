## üöÄ **PHASE 1: Setup Digital Asset Links**

Digital Asset Links verify that you own the domain and authorize the Android app to open your website.

### **Step 1.1: Add Asset Links Route to Flask App**

Open `app.py` and add this route:

```python
@customer_app.route('/.well-known/assetlinks.json')
def asset_links():
    """Digital Asset Links for Android TWA"""
    return jsonify([{
        "relation": ["delegate_permission/common.handle_all_urls"],
        "target": {
            "namespace": "android_app",
            "package_name": "com.kathape.customer",
            "sha256_cert_fingerprints": [
                "REPLACE_WITH_YOUR_SHA256_FINGERPRINT"
            ]
        }
    }]), 200, {'Content-Type': 'application/json'}
```

### **Step 1.2: Generate SHA256 Fingerprint**

You'll get the fingerprint after creating your signing key in Phase 2. For now, leave it as placeholder.

---

## üöÄ **PHASE 2: Install Bubblewrap CLI**

Bubblewrap is Google's official tool for creating TWA apps.

### **Step 2.1: Install Bubblewrap**

```bash
npm install -g @bubblewrap/cli
```

### **Step 2.2: Verify Installation**

```bash
bubblewrap help
```

### **Step 2.3: Install Android SDK via Bubblewrap**

```bash
bubblewrap doctor
```

This will check your environment and help install missing components.

---

## üöÄ **PHASE 3: Initialize TWA Project**

### **Step 3.1: Create TWA Project**

```bash
cd /Users/sidhartha/Desktop
mkdir KathaPe-Customer-Android
cd KathaPe-Customer-Android

bubblewrap init --manifest=https://khatape.tech/manifest.json
```

### **Step 3.2: Answer the Setup Questions**

When prompted, enter:

```
Domain being opened in the TWA: khatape.tech
Name of the application: KathaPe Customer
Application package name: com.kathape.customer
Launcher name: KathaPe
Display mode (fullscreen/standalone): standalone
Orientation (any/portrait/landscape): portrait
Theme color: #1a1a2e (or your brand color)
Background color: #16213e (or your brand color)
Icon URL: https://khatape.tech/static/icon-512x512.png
Maskable icon URL: (leave blank if not available)
Splash screen color: #16213e
Status bar color: #1a1a2e
```

---

## üöÄ **PHASE 4: Create Signing Key**

### **Step 4.1: Generate Release Keystore**

```bash
cd KathaPe-Customer-Android

keytool -genkey -v -keystore kathape-release-key.keystore -alias kathape-key -keyalg RSA -keysize 2048 -validity 10000
```

**Enter the following information when prompted:**
- Password: Choose a strong password (save it securely!)
- First and Last Name: Your name or company name
- Organizational Unit: Development
- Organization: KathaPe
- City/Locality: Your city
- State/Province: Your state
- Country Code: IN (for India)

**‚ö†Ô∏è IMPORTANT: Save these details securely!**
- Keystore file location
- Keystore password
- Key alias: `kathape-key`
- Key password

### **Step 4.2: Get SHA256 Fingerprint**

```bash
keytool -list -v -keystore kathape-release-key.keystore -alias kathape-key
```

Look for the line starting with `SHA256:` and copy the fingerprint (format: `AA:BB:CC:...`).

### **Step 4.3: Update Digital Asset Links**

Go back to your Flask app and update the `asset_links()` route with the real SHA256 fingerprint:

```python
"sha256_cert_fingerprints": [
    "AA:BB:CC:DD:EE:FF:00:11:22:33:44:55:66:77:88:99:AA:BB:CC:DD:EE:FF:00:11:22:33:44:55:66:77:88:99"
]
```

### **Step 4.4: Deploy Updated Asset Links**

```bash
cd /Users/sidhartha/Desktop/KathaPe-Customer
git add app.py
git commit -m "Add Digital Asset Links for Android TWA"
git push origin main
```

Wait for Render to deploy, then verify:
```bash
curl https://khatape.tech/.well-known/assetlinks.json
```

## üöÄ **PHASE 5: Build the Android App**

### **Step 5.1: Update Bubblewrap Configuration**

Edit `twa-manifest.json` in your Android project:

```json
{
  "signingKey": {
    "path": "./kathape-release-key.keystore",
    "alias": "kathape-key"
  }
}
```

### **Step 5.2: Build the APK**

```bash
cd /Users/sidhartha/Desktop/KathaPe-Customer-Android

bubblewrap build
```

Enter your keystore password when prompted.

### **Step 5.3: Locate the Built APK**

The APK will be at:
```
KathaPe-Customer-Android/app/build/outputs/bundle/release/app-release-bundle.aab
```

## üöÄ **PHASE 6: Test the App**

- Without the original keystore, you CANNOT update your app

### **Version Management**

- Update `versionName` for user-visible versions
- Follow semantic versioning (1.0.0, 1.1.0, 2.0.0)

### **Digital Asset Links**
- Must be accessible at https://khatape.tech/.well-known/assetlinks.json
- Must return valid JSON with correct SHA256 fingerprint
- Must be publicly accessible (no authentication required)

### **Domain Changes**
- If you change hosting platforms, keep khatape.tech pointing to new server
- No app update needed if domain stays same
- If domain changes, you must rebuild and resubmit app

---

## üÜò **Troubleshooting**
